:wave: Hello and welcome to the Pixie project. <br/>
:eyes: The vision is to create a verbose skeleton project that can be used to jumpstart app ideas. <br/>
:hourglass: This will save time that would usually be spent initializing React, Express, nodeJS and Mongo, as well as setting up a test suite.<br/>
:crystal_ball:As the project continues to grow, I hope to add more features such as:

- an authentication suite
- a deployment pipeline
- hosting instructions
- a sample README. <br/>
  Bon voyage!
