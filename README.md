# Pixie

:wave:Hello and welcome to the Pixie project.
The vision is to create a verbose skeleton project that can be used to jumpstart app ideas. This will save time that would usually be spent initializing react, express, node and Mongo, as well as setting up a test suite. As the project continues to grow, I hope to add more features such as:

- authentication suite
- a deployment pipeline
- hosting instructions
- Sample README.
  Bon voyage!
