# Pixie

![Toonlink blue pixie companion](/public/pixie.webp)
:wave: Hello and welcome to the Pixie project. <br/>
:eyes: The vision is to create a verbose skeleton project that can be used to jumpstart app ideas. <br/>
:clock: This will save time that would usually be spent initializing React, Express, nodeJS and Mongo, as well as setting up a test suite.
:crystal_ball:As the project continues to grow, I hope to add more features such as:

- authentication suite
- a deployment pipeline
- hosting instructions
- Sample README.
  Bon voyage!
